## Technologies
* Tech 1 - version 1.0

## Setup
npm install 

## i18n
For the translations we use angular i18n architecture (following https://medium.com/dailyjs/maintaining-multi-language-angular-applications-26b74df8d085) and the tool ng-extract-i18n-merge (https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge)
1. npm run translate => ng extract-i18n => 
  1.1 Generates messages.xlf file with texts to be translated
  1.2 Based on extract-i18n defined in angular.json it merges the new translations to the xlf target files adding an attribute new those added translations.
2. npm run start-es => ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --configuration=es => runs the app with the translated for a specific language in DEV
3. npm run start-prod => ng build --configuration=production --localize => it makes new builds for production with the default locale (en-US) and the different languages (es so far)

## Deploy Client
npm start (with proxy.conf to distinguish PROD vs DEV - https://medium.com/@asfo/creando-un-proxy-en-angular-para-conectarte-a-un-api-local-y-de-producci%C3%B3n-106c34cd9815)
