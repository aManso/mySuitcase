>What does the future hold for travel? Check-in by robot? Budget space flights? Virtual holidays? Weâ€™ve digested the findings and come up with a revolutionary idea that we think would benefit the world of travel.

## Technologies
* Angular v16 (updated in July 2023)
* node v16.20.1
* npm v8.19.4

## Setup
  `npm install`

## i18n
For the translations we use angular i18n architecture (following https://medium.com/dailyjs/maintaining-multi-language-angular-applications-26b74df8d085) and the tool ng-extract-i18n-merge (https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge)
1. `npm run translate` => `ng extract-i18n` => 
  1.1 Generates messages.xlf file with texts to be translated
  1.2 Based on extract-i18n defined in angular.json it merges the new translations to the xlf target files adding an attribute state="new" to those added translations.
2. `npm run start-es` => `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --configuration=es-ES` => runs the app with the translated for a specific language in DEV
3. `npm run start-prod` => `ng build --configuration=production --localize` => it makes new builds for production with the default locale (en-US) and the different languages (es so far) . Currently there is an error in angular.json configuration production optimization option when doing the build, so the inlineCritical option has to be desactivated.

## Deploy
  ### Locally
  `npm run start` (with proxy.conf to distinguish PROD vs DEV - https://medium.com/@asfo/creando-un-proxy-en-angular-para-conectarte-a-un-api-local-y-de-producci%C3%B3n-106c34cd9815)
  ### Production
  `npm run start-prod` (in dist folder)

## Tests
  `npm run test` 

## Lint
  `npm run lint`

        * 1. `ng add @angular/pwa` - creates manifest, ngsw-config.json and icons and Also, it modifies angular.json, package.json, index.html and app.module.ts .
        * 2. configure the cache files in manifest
        * 3. We add pwa-installer.js and its component and service to show an installer button into the html and trigger the same behaviour to install the pwa
